# AGV-Emulator
Use multiple computers to emulate the real AGV system

This model should be run on multiple computers(at least 3) to emulator the real world AGV system.
-One computer is for Center Contor System. (excecute run.py in E_Server_V1 folder.)
-One is for Environment hardware like sensor or MES. (excecute run.py in E_Center_V1 folder.)
-One is for AGV itself. (excecute run.py in E_AGV_V1 folder.)

Firstly, edit all run.py file for changing the IP location for each computers. The excuter the corresponding run.py file in each computers.
